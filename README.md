##Background

Stripe rust of wheat is caused by a basidiomycete pathogen called Puccinia triticina. Parallel lines of pustules form on the leaves of wheat plants, releasing enormous numbers of spores, especially when it is cool and humid. Spores are dispersed by wind, sometimes very far, and infect more wheat or other grass hosts. It can cause up to 50% loss of crop yields and seems to be adapting to warmer temperatures and resistant varieties of wheat. This disease is typically controlled using resistance, but fungicides also work.

I will be using data found on this tutorial to explore the effects of wheat cultivar and fungicide treatment on the incidence of disease caused by Puccinia triticina. I will do this by comparing the AUDPC (area under disease progress curve) for the three cultivars and two fungicide treatments.
